# AA Second Assignment

The objective of this project was to design and test a randomized algorithm to solve the combinatorial problem from the first assignment, which was to find a minimum weighted closure for a given vertex-weighted directed graph G(V, E), with n vertices and m edges. This randomized algorithm was based on the Monte Carlo algorithms, and all the computations were made using a variety of parameters, which are referred on the report.
